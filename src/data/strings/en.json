With a minimalist design and high flexibility, Bamboo Bot uses standard FTC components easily found locally, combined with cost-saving solutions such as a drivetrain using ball bearings instead of omni wheels, an intake-transfer mechanism using rubber bands, and a high-performance single flywheel shooter.",
      "d2": "Accompanied by detailed CAD files and clearly written, easily customizable code, Bamboo Bot provides a solid foundation for new teams—especially those lacking mentors—to focus on learning and skill development rather than struggling with complex designs from scratch."
